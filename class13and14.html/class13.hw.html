    My Top 3 Favourite Movie Series
 </h1> 
    <div><h3>
        Zombies</h3>
   <br>
 <p>
        I love the move <i>Zombies</i>. It has altogether 3 movies:Zombies;Zombies2;Zombies3. All movies show case 
        different creatures coming together.In the first movies humans and zombies come together. In the second movie
        werewolves join, and in the third one aliens join them.

           <div> <h3>
        Harry Potter
    </h3><BR>
    <p>
        I'd rank Harry Potter as my third favourite movie series. It has 8 movies. It all starts with 11 year old 
        Harry Potter  who lives with his not-so nice aunt and uncle and cousin. He gets accepted at Hogwarts School
        of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>

   <div> <h3>
Descendents
</h3><BR>
        <p>
            Descendents is my second favourite movie series.It has 3 parts:Descendents,Descendents2 and Descendents3.
            It starts with evil Villian Kids(VKs) who are trapped on the Isle of the Lost.The kids get a chance to go 
            to Auradon Prep a schoolfor the Aks(Auradon kids). The series ends with the barrier preventing the villians
            from getting out is taken down.
