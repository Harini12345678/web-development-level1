Wonder Woman is my favourite superhero.She shows that girls can be super heros too.She is one of the fiercest 
superheros ever(I don't know that many superheros cause I don't watch those kind of movies).Her original name is Diana
who was raised on Themyscira who posseses gifts from the gods. Drawn to her destiny she joins the avengers to battle evil.
She wears something like a crown, she uses a shield and a magic rope called the 'Lasso of Truth'.</p>
