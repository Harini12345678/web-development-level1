        All on Students
    </h2>
    <p>
    We have inter house competitions between houses but we ensure that this does not get too serious.Each 
    class will have students from each house. We also form our class on the basis of each students 
    strengths and weaknesses.For example, if there are 8 students in a class, 2 will be good at academics,2 
    will be good at music and dance, 2 will be good at athletics and 2 will be good at art.There might not
    be exact equal divisions but there will be a moderate amount of everything.Our classes are made like      
    this so that one child can help anothere where they struggle. The members of the student council
    govern the school in the absence of the teachers. These members are well disciplined students.
    The examples of <i> when</i> these students moniter are <b>when teachers of practicing for teachers 
        day and are unable to take class the student council members moniter the classes. </b>
