        //there are two types of functions :
//Inbuilt function :  These are given to us by javascript. It does some function for us example : document.write()

//User defined functions : These are those functions which coder creates by itself for two reasons :
//- To make code more organzied because function is like a group where code can be stored. So you can create  many such functions like this where you can put of your code.
//- It also helps you reuse the same code again by writing the name of teh functions
//without copy paste thing
