        Brief about the Titanic
    </h3>
        <p>
            The construction of the Titanic began  on 31st March 1909 and ended on 31st March 1912. The Titanic was 
built by the White Star Line and was the biggest and the most luxurious ship at the time and left the port on 10th
April 1912. The interior was similar to that of the Ritz Hotel in London and the first class got the most luxurious cabins 
and comforts ever to be on any ship.The Titanic was a oceanliner who had 2 sister ships: the Olypic and the Brittanic.
The Titanic was sunk by an iceberg on it's maiden voyage and it sank from 11:30  on April 14th to 2:20 on April 15th.Here
is one of the leading causes for how one of the biggest and safest ship was sunk by an iceberg.

    <h3>
        A Tiny Key
    </h3><p>
Some time before the Titanic was about to leave the port, the officials decided to replace the 2nd officer David Blair with
Charles Lightoller as they saw him as a more experienced sailor with better skills at maneuvering large ships. In his
distress and hurry to leave the port, he forgot to hand over the key of the binocular cabinet to his replacement.Only
after the Titanic left and was sailing in the ocean was this detail remembered. However the lookouts were confident
they would easily be able to spot danger.But as fate would have it they  couldn't spot the iceberg in time.
