  <h2>Vision</h2> <br> <br> <br> 
  <p>
    How <b><i>DPS</i></b>  wants to become the best school in the world is a different story. If more students join and they stay 
    long or till school ends Dps will have better chances of being the best school in both India and Bangalore
    and moves one step closer to being the best school in the world. Another way it can achieve it's goal is by
    ensuring that it's students score execellent marks and are amazing at many extracurricular activities and win 
    all interschool competitions such as football and cricket. Also if all teachers advertise the school to their 
    freinds, many more people might join and they  might reccomend the school to their freinds.
