      My favourite dinner or lunch is always pizza. Normally I buy either cheese or chicken pizza but if I have to eat 
      veg pizza I would take off all of the toppings and eat eat it. It goes good with lava cake and soda.

      My favourite dessert is icecream and it is also a very good snack. If I think of a cold dessert, I'm 
      thinking of icecream for sure.I can't even pick my favourite cauuse every flavour is amazing.
