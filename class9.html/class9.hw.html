            It was a cold rainy January night.<br>
            Lucky for me I was warm and cozy inside my mouse hole.I was 
          <span style="color:pink ;font-style:sans-serif;font-weight:60px">nestled</span>
             in my favourite pawchair infront of
            a cheery fire.<br>
            "This is the life!" I squeaked popping a 
            <span style=" color:brown;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">chocolate cheese cupcake</span>
             into my mouth and opening my book.I felt
            so relaxed.Everything was so peaceful. But then............<br>
            <i>Rattle!Rattle</i><br>
            The window was rattling right behind my chair!<br>
            I decided to play some some 
            <span style="color:pink ;font-family:sans-serif;font-weight:60px" >soothing music.  </span>      </p>
